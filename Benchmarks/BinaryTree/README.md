# Binary tree

Build a balanced binary tree with a specified number of nodes and count the number of nodes at each depth.

Usage: `./program [nodes]`

Alternate versions were written for C++ and Rust where arena allocators are used. C++ uses `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` and Rust uses the `bumpalo` library.
